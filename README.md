# Lunar Lander: Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Landing

This project demonstrates the application of Deep Q-Learning (DQL) to solve the Lunar Lander problem, a classic reinforcement learning challenge. The goal is to train an agent to successfully land a lunar module on the moon's surface using optimal control strategies.

## Project Overview

- **Environment**: The Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI's Gym library.
- **Algorithm**: Deep Q-Learning (DQL), an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks.
- **Objective**: Train an agent to land the lunar module safely by optimizing its actions through experience and exploration.

## Features

- Implementation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) with experience replay and target network.
- Visualization of training progress and agent's performance.
- Evaluation of the trained agent's ability to land the lunar module in different scenarios.

## How to Run
**1. Access the Colab Notebook**: Open the Lunar Lander Colab Notebook to view and run the project code directly in Google Colab.

**2. Run the Cells**: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to train the agent and visualize its performance.

**3. Evaluate the Agent**: After training, evaluate the agent's performance by running the evaluation cells in the notebook.
